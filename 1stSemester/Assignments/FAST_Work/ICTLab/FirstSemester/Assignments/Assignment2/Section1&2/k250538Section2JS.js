    Also Miss, for some reason when using prompt, when you make the very first input, it reprints the entire menu for some reason.
    After the first sudden reprint, then it starts taking inputs as needed and works how its supposed to.
    I dont know why its doing that or how to fix it, so I hope you can overlook this. I suspect its a issue with the prompt itself.
